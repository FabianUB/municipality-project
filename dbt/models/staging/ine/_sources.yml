          **Data Quality Notes**:
          - Some records have null municipality codes (8,098 records) - this is a known data quality issue
          - Province codes are stored as zero-padded text ("01", "02") and need integer conversion
          - Municipality codes (cmun) are stored as numeric with possible decimal notation ("2.0")
